How to run
---
python3 Interpreter.py [test.core] [test.data]

Source code and any input data are passed in as a CLI arg. If `read` is called and no data file was provided, it will print an error and exit.

Usage information will print if a file is not provided, and an error will show if an invalid file is provided.
Development/testing was completed on Ubuntu, but it only uses the sys & os packages so it should work on any OS without issue.
